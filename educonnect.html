      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout our years in the public education system, we've witnessed
        teachers expressing their frustrations when it came to communicating
        with the administration of their school districts. At times, they felt
        ignored and disconnected from the administrators. We've also heard of
        teachers voicing how stressful their jobs are. We wanted to explore and
        look more into this and find a way to empower teachers and bring unity
        to the education system by creating an environment that supports
        learning and accessibility.
      </p>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Create a social media platform for Administration and Teachers to
        facilitate communication and provide resources to improve the quality of
        life in the classroom.
      </p>
      <h2>Survey Results​​​​​​​</h2>
      <p>- 85% of teachers spend less than an hour checking e-mail each day</p>
      <p>- 90% of teachers say that their job is stressful</p>
      <p>
        - Only half spent more than 2 hours on education-related software,
        despite reporting themselves as tech-savvy
      </p>
      <p>
        - 75% of teachers expressed that they did not have a clear idea of who
        to go to for help
      </p>
      <p>
        - All six interviewees expressed different day-to-day issues in the
        classroom
      </p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        EDUConnect should be able to be used easily and swiftly; Teachers do not
        want to spend too much time on the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        EDUConnect should allow teachers to find help with various issues
        without too much searching.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app should give teachers a support system among other teachers and
        administrators.
      </p>
